  Run a self-hosted instance of Renovate.

  Configuration:
  1. Create a Renovate self-hosted configuration file (eg. renovate.config.js).
  2. Pass the file path into the config_file_path parameter.
  3. Commit and push the changes to the branch configured in the schedule filter branch. This is usually the default branch (eg. master).
  For more information, see:
  - https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/usage/self-hosting.md#user-content-configuration
  - https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/usage/self-hosted-configuration.md
  - https://docs.renovatebot.com/self-hosted-configuration

  Secrets should be configured using environment variables (eg. RENOVATE_TOKEN, GITHUB_COM_TOKEN).

  Configure environment variables in CircleCI Project Settings. To share environment variables across projects, use CircleCI Contexts (https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/).

  For more information and examples, see: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/usage/self-hosting.md

              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
                    - master
      jobs:
        - renovate/self-hosted:
