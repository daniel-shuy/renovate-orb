  Run a self-hosted instance of Renovate.

  Authentication:
  1. Create a bot account for the Git repository.
  2. Generate a Personal Access Token for the bot account.
  3. In Project Settings, configure the RENOVATE_REPOSITORY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable (or alternately the name of environment variable passed into the repository_auth_token parameter) as the generated Personal Access Token.
  For more information, see: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/master/docs/usage/self-hosting.md#user-content-authentication

  Configuration:
  1. Create a Renovate self-hosted configuration file (eg. renovate.config.js).
  2. Pass the file path into the config_file_path parameter.
  3. Commit and push the changes to the branch configured in the schedule filter branch. This is usually the default branch (eg. master).
